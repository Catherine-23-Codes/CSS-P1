    <h1>Tech</h1>
    <p>
      In the world of technology, it seems every gadget is trying to outsmart
      the last. Imagine a phone so clever it tells you when to drink water, yet
      cant remember where you left your keys! While robots may cook our dinners,
      they still cant understand why we prefer pizza. This delightful irony
      makes us chuckle, reminding us that sometimes, the smartest devices can be
      remarkably silly. As we marvel at our tech companions, its clear: while
      they may be intelligent, they still keep us guessing!
